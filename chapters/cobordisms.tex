\label{cha:cobordisms}

We now delve into some arguments for smooth manifolds.
Once the general idea is in place, the following chapters make explicit the corresponding construction for triangulations of manifolds.

The problems of this chapter lie in the realm of cobordism.
\begin{defn}
  \label{def:cobordism}
  Let $W$ be a manifold with boundary $\pd W=M_1\cup M_2$.
  We say that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are \emph{cobordant} and $W$ is a \emph{cobordism} of the pair $(M_1,M_2)$.
\end{defn}
As discussed in the introduction, there are many ways to prove that a closed, oriented 3--manifold is cobordant to $\emptyset$.
Our goal is to take a 3--manifold triangulation $M$ and produce an explicit triangulated cobordism $W$ from $M$ to $\emptyset$.
