The problem ``which closed 3--manifolds bound 4--manifolds?'' was solved in the 1950's.
The answer is ``all of them,'' and there are many methods of proof of this fact.
Some are constructive, i.e.\ an explicit 4--manifold is constructed from an input 3--manifold.
The 2008 paper ``3--manifolds efficiently bound 4--manifolds'' by Francesco Costantino and Dylan Thurston gives an overview for a process that produces a bound on the number of 4--simplices needed to triangulate a 4--manifold for a given input triangulated 3-manifold.
Costantino and Thurston sketch a proof in the smooth case and provide full proof in the piecewise--linear case.
We use the groundwork laid by Costantino and Thurston to provide a proof in the smooth case.
