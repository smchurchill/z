We proceed to an overview of the tools used in the next chapter to construct manifolds.
Section~\ref{sec:surgery} discusses the various ways that a pair of manifolds may be glued together to produce new manifolds.
Section~\ref{sec:heegard} examines how to identify a manifold based on structures within that manifold.
Section~\ref{sec:morsetheory} introduces Morse Theory --- a practice that gleans information about a manifold by smoothly cramming it into a one--dimensional space.
