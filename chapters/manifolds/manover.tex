Our first task is to build the machinery necessary to describe manifolds.
We begin with a quick, formal definition, and build some basic properties.
Next, we talk about a method of building and augmenting manifolds using handles.
We end by defining triangulations: a combinatorial description of a manifold that allows us to cleanly describe our algorithms.

This chapter is intended as a review of common tools in geometric topology so, in most places, full proof will be omitted.
A knowledge of the fundamental properties and definitions of smooth maps is assumed.
