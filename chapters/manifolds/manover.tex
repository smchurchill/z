Our first task is to build the machinery necessary to describe manifolds.
We begin with a formal definition of \emph{manifold}, and develop some basic properties and descriptors of manifolds.
%Next, we talk about a method of building and augmenting manifolds using standard operations.
We end by defining CW--complexes and triangulations, common combinatorial data types used to describe manifolds.

This chapter is intended as a review of common tools in geometric topology so, in most places, full proof will be omitted.
A knowledge of the fundamental properties and definitions of smooth maps between real vector spaces is assumed.
For full details on the fundamentals of smooth manifold theory, refer to the texts \cite{GompStip}, \cite{Hirsch67}, \cite{Kosi93}, or \cite{Lee00}.
%For details on manifolds with corners, refer to Chapter 3 of \cite{JSP}.
