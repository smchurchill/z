The existence of tubular neighbourhoods was guaranteed only for closed submanifolds of closed manifolds.
We can extend our results to manifolds with boundary as long as the boundaries satisfy some niceness conditions.

\begin{defn}[Neat Submanifold]
	We use here $\ttilde{\HH}^m$ to denote the subspace of $\HH\times\R^{n-1}$ for which the last $n-m$ coordinates are $0$. 
	Let $X\subset M$ be a $m$--submanifold of the $n$--manifold $M$ satisfying the following conditions:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $X$ is a topologically closed subset of $M$,
		\item $X\cap \pd M=\pd X$, and
		\item for every $x\in\pd X$, there is a chart $(U,f)$ of $M$ with $f:U\to\HH\times\R^{n-1}$ such that $f\inv(\tilde{\HH}^m)=U\cap X$.
	\end{enumerate}
	Then $X$ is a \emph{neat} submanifold of $M$.
	The last condition for neatness essentially guarantees that $\pd X$ meets $\pd M$ the same way that $\tilde{\HH}^m$ meets $\HH\times\R^{n-1}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Neat Tubular Neighbourhood]
	Let $X$ be a neat submanifold of $M$, and $\nu X$ a tubular neighbourhood of $X$.
	We say that $\nu X$ is a \emph{neat tubular neighbourhood} if $\nu X\cap \pd M$ is a tubular neighbourhood of $\pd X$ in $\pd M$.	
\end{defn}

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 3.4.2 of \cite{Kosi93}]
	If $X$ is a neat submanifold of $M$, then it has a neat tubular neighbourhood.
\end{theorem}

For $X$ a closed submanifold of $\pd M$, our definitions guarantee a tubular neighbourhood of $X$ in $\pd M$, but not of $X$ in $M$.
Letting $X=\pd M$, notice that $\pd M$ has a trivial normal bundle $\pd M\times \R$ in $M$, and a collar that is an embedding of $\pd M\times\HH^1$ in $M$.
It is clear that an appropriate analogue of the tubular neighbourhood to submanifolds of the boundary would be a generalization of the collar to a half-tubular neighbourhood.

\begin{defn}
	\label{def:halfneighbourhood}
	Let $W$ be a manifold with boundary and let $X$ be a submanifold of $M=\pd W$.
	The normal bundle of $X$ in $W$ is the fiber-wise direct sum of $N_M X$ with $\restr{(N_W M)}{X}$.
	Because $N_W M$ is a trivial bundle, the normal bundle of $X$ in $W$ is just $N_M X\times \R$.
	We can only embed one half of $N_M X\times \R$ in $W$, so we extend $f$ to an embedding $F:N_M X\times \HH^1\to W$ such that $F$ restricted to $z(N_M X)\times\HH^1$ coincides with a collar of $M$ on $X$.
\end{defn}

Our theorems regarding the existence and uniqueness of tubular neighbourhoods extend with the definition.
Proper tubular neighbourhoods are defined in exactly the same way, and uniqueness up to isotopy is now uniqueness up to composition of isotopies of $\nu_M X$ and isotopies of the collar neighbourhood.
